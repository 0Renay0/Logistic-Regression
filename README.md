# Logistic Regression
This repository contains an implementation of Logistic Regression using Python and NumPy. 
The implementation includes data generation, normalization, model training, and evaluation.

## Context 
The success of the exam of a group of students depends on how long they worked and slept. To succeed in the exam, the student should
have at least 4 hours of work, 5 hours of sleep and 3 hours at maximum spent on games. Otherwise, they fail.

## Data 
The data set is composed of two vectors, $X$ is the observation vector and $Y$ is the class vector:

$X=(x_{1},x_{2})^T$ 

with $x_1$ the number of hours of work and $x_2$ the number of hours of sleep.

$Y = $
\begin{cases}
$1$ \\
$0$
\end{cases}
